Research shows that students who have higher flow experience tend to show higher learning performances.

                        p Heart rate variability (HRV) is the variation in the time between consecutive heartbeats in milliseconds. IRIS is found to boost HRV, and an increased HRV is connected to reduced mortality and an overall improvement in cardiac health.
