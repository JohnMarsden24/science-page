                p.m5.max8.mb-200 Flow is related to dopamine, a key neurochemical relevant for learning and reward. The release of endorphins and other neurochemicals during flow state further makes the activity extremely rewarding.

                p When we are fully focused and engaged in an activity, we are able to digest more information but with effortless attention, and return to the activity more successfully, therefore increasing our memory retention in the process. Research shows that students who have higher flow experience tend to show higher learning performances.
